## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

4. Initialize the vector database:
```bash
python src/utils/setup_vector_db.py
```

## Usage

1. Start the API server:
```bash
python src/api/main.py
```

2. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000`

3. For development and model training:
```bash
python src/models/training/train.py
```

## Model Training
